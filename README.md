## Purpose
The purpose of this database is to manage a hair salon's operations, including tracking customers, employees, services offered, appointments scheduled, and payments made.
## Schema
![Hair Salon ERD](hair-salon-erd.png)
## Sample Questions
### Success
One example of a successful question was:
"What is the total revenue from payments?"
The result of this question was:

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue FROM Payments;
[(130.0,)]
The total revenue from payments is 130.0.

Basically, it resulted in the query generated by ChatGPT, the raw result of the query, and the "friendly" version of the result in plain, readable text.
### Failure(?) (not really)
This is the question that I was expecting to result in a failure:
"Can you tell me about the people who work here and what they do?"
The result of this question, shockingly not a failure, was this:

SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.position
FROM Employees e;
[(1, 'Emma Davis', 'Stylist'), (2, 'Liam Wilson', 'Barber'), (3, 'Olivia Martinez', 'Receptionist')]
We have Emma Davis, a stylist; Liam Wilson, a barber; and Olivia Martinez, our receptionist.

Again, the response is in the same format: generated query, raw result, and readable result. I was shocked that ChatGPT was able to make a cohesive query that actually resulted in a successful result out of this question when it is somewhat vague. Super impressive for ChatGPT!

## All Outputs
See all the inputs and outputs in the inputs-outputs file in the repo.

## Prompting Strategies
I used the same prompting strategies as those in the starter code. They worked great, and both produced very clear and readable responses, and also made similarly structured queries.
